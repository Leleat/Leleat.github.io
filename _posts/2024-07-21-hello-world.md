ðŸ‘‹ Greetings, and welcome to my blog!

Introduction are usually the thing that people do first... so here it goes. My name is Anh Le. I'm based in Berlin and currently studying business informatics. I've decided to create this blog to share my journey, and thoughts on various topics. My interests lie primarily in software development, especially the user-facing side and open-source, video games, and food.

## What this is all about and what I've been up to so far

On this blog, you'll mostly find posts about my trials and errors in software development. Here's a bit of what I've done until now:

I dabbled with the Godot game engine a while back. It was an interesting experience, albeit a short-lived one due to my complete lack of artistic skills ðŸ˜‚. Despite that, it was fun while it lasted.

Currently, I'm developing some [GNOME extensions](https://gjs.guide/extensions/). One notable project is [Tiling Assistant](https://github.com/Leleat/Tiling-Assistant), which brings some of Windows' tiling features over to the GNOME desktop, along with extra features like [tile groups](https://github.com/Leleat/Tiling-Assistant/wiki/Tile-Groups). I'm pretty happy with where Tiling Assistant is UX-wise. The code, on the other hand... yikes. I started it four years ago when I had little to no experience. While I'm not saying I'm much better now, I do feel more comfortable with coding and looking at other people's code. Refactoring (the core structure of) Tiling Assistant is on my to-do list, and hopefully, I can write some unit tests along with it. I also plan to write a post-mortem â€“ or I guess more like a pre-mortem â€“ about the development of Tiling Assistant.

As for job-related things: I've just started working part-time in an office for public administration. There I mainly do web development. This should, in theory, be the more instructive part on my way to become better developer. However, it doesn't work quite as well as it should, mainly because I don't have a mentor or supervisor to guide me on a technical level. There isn't anyone in my team who can fill that role. But that's a rant for another day - and probably not something to dive into on a public blog ðŸ™ƒ. So with all that said...

Hello world, nice to meet you!
